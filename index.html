    <h2 class="Antarctic-Reigon">What is the Antarctic Region?</h2>
    <p>  Antarctica is a continent that is one of the most popular places on Earth. It has beautiful views and freezing temperatures which can be an amazing sight to see.
        It is found in the southern hemisphere of the Earth and is considered one of the biggestcontinents out of the 7.
        Antarctica is normally freezing and very remote due to the lack of precipitation in the area. It spreads as far out as 1.9km (1.2m)</p>
    <h2>What biome(s) would you find there?</h2>
    <p>  In antarctica, there is only 1 main biome on land. It is a Polar Desert. A polar desert is a type of desert that is normally in a region with a average temperature
        of 10 degrees Celsius during the warmest months. It is classified as a desert due to the lack of snow and precipitation in the area. Antarctica is actually known as
        the largest desert on Earth.</p>
    <h2>What is the Climate like?</h2>
    <p>  Antarctica has the coldest climate on the planet. The driest, windiest, and coldest continent on Earth is Antarctica.
        The inside has an average temperature of roughly -71 degrees Fahrenheit. The average temperature at the coast is roughly -14 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>
    <h2>What does the natural environment look like?</h2>
    <p>  In Antarctica, there is ice everywhere. From left, right and centre you will see ice ice and more ice. It is the coldest, driest, highest (on average) and
        windiest continent on Earth. During Summer months, it is usually very mild averaging up to 33-36 degrees fahrenheit. And during Winter months, it is usually freezing
        cold averaging as low as -34-38 degrees fahrenheit.</p>
    <h2>What are the features of ecosystems in the area?</h2>
    <p>mosses. Despite being among the largest terrestrial species, springtails are
        actually only 1-3 mm long. Antarctica's wildlife is diverse and unique. It is the only continent on Earth which has no terrestrial mammals, but is home to a range of marine wildlife and birds,
        including penguins. The most common birds in Antarctica are penguins. It is home to 18 different species that spread out across Antarctica.</p>
    <h2>How are animals and plants in the area Interdependant?</h2>
    <p>  The consumers that feed by grazing or filter feeding require the plants (producers). Corals, urchins, and snails are a few examples.
        Sea stars and other animals will eat these consumers in turn. Larger species (consumers) including fish, penguins, seals, and whales are at the top of the food chain.</p>
    <h2>What are some examples of Human Impact in the area?</h2>
    <p> Some Antarctic species are being harvested to the point of extinction for commercial gain, killing and upsetting other species, poisoning the soils,
        dumping sewage into the sea, leaving trash, cairns, and trails. These all are different human imoacts in the area. They cause damage to the ecosystem, environment as a
        whole and food chain alike. One more major humman impact is global warming. Global warming is popular in Antarctica as it is affecting it day by day. This can also
        affect wild-life as it melts ice in the area which is crucial for different ecosystems in land and in water.</p>
    <h2>What are the threats facing Antarctica?</h2>
    <p>  Antarctica's temperature has changed unevenly, with some areas seeing warming and others seeing little to no change, even cold. Temperatures have increased by more
        than 3°C on the Antarctic Peninsula, which is a portion of West Antarctica, over the second half of the 20th century. Together with rising fishing and tourism,
        climate change poses a threat to the region's amazing biodiversity. Pressures from geopolitics and fresh interest in Antarctic natural resources are growing.
        Expanding fishing operations around the region is becoming more popular as global fisheries become more depleted</p>
    <h2>Why is the structure of Antarctica important?</h2>
    <p>  Benefits: Preserves dry, cool air by reducing heat transfer between the ocean and atmosphere. Ultimately, the melting of sea ice causes the atmosphere and
        ocean to cool. The amount of sea ice is vital to the climate of the Southern Ocean because it restricts the flow of energy.</p>
